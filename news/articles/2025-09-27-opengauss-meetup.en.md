On September 27, 2025, the openGauss Meetup in Chengdu was successfully held. The openGauss RISC‑V SIG presented key progress on the RISC‑V architecture:

- Porting from openGauss 5.1.0 to 7.0.0 (full versions) with notable performance improvements;
- A containerized deployment solution to streamline distribution and delivery;
- Ongoing technical optimizations and ecosystem building for broader real‑world adoption.

The team also announced the “Jiachen Program” internship recruitment. Students and developers interested in databases, operating systems, and the RISC‑V ecosystem are invited to join and help accelerate open‑source databases on RISC‑V.
