## Install RuyiSDK Package Manager

Take the x86_64 binary as an example. Add execution permissions to the file:

```bash
$ chmod +x ./ruyi.amd64
```

Move the binary to a directory in your system's ``PATH``:

```bash
$ sudo cp -v ruyi.amd64 /usr/local/bin/ruyi
```

:::tip
Ensure the file name is ``ruyi``.

Run the following command to verify the installation:

```bash
$ ruyi version
```

If the command outputs the version and copyright information, Ruyi is installed successfully. If it fails, check your system environment and repeat the steps.
