## Download RuyiSDK Package Manager

RuyiSDK Package Manager provides pre-built binaries for x86_64, riscv64, and aarch64 architectures. Run ``uname -m`` to check your system architecture, then download the appropriate binary.

For ``x86_64``：

<DownloadRuyi arch="x86_64" />

For ``aarch64``：

<DownloadRuyi arch="aarch64" />

For ``riscv64``：

<DownloadRuyi arch="riscv64" />

:::tip
If the page does not properly display the download link, you can visit the [RuyiSDK mirror](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/) for the latest binaries. You can also find them on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases).
:::

### Install RuyiSDK Package Manager

Take the x86_64 binary as an example. Add execution permissions to the file:

```bash
$ chmod +x ./ruyi.amd64
```

Move the binary to a directory in your system's ``PATH``:

```bash
$ sudo cp -v ruyi.amd64 /usr/local/bin/ruyi
```

:::tip
Ensure the file name is ``ruyi``.
:::

Run the following command to verify the installation:

```bash
$ ruyi version
```

If the command outputs the version and copyright information, Ruyi is installed successfully. If it fails, check your system environment and repeat the steps.

## Download RuyiSDK IDE

RuyiSDK IDE has also released binaries for three architectures: x86_64, riscv64, and aarch64.

You can download the tarball suitable for your architecture:

```bash
$ wget https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ide/0.0.3/ruyisdk-0.0.3-linux.gtk."$(uname -m)".tar.gz
```

:::tip
This document is time-sensitive. If the links point to an outdated version of Ruyi, visit the [RuyiSDK mirror](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ide/) for the latest binaries. 
:::

### Install RuyiSDK IDE

The following demonstrates how to install RuyiSDK IDE into the ``/opt/ruyisdk`` directory.

First, create the directory: 

```bash
$ sudo mkdir /opt/ruyisdk
```

Unpack the tarball. This step requires tar and gunzip, and ensure the downloaded tarball path is adjusted based on your actual location: 

```bash
$ cd /opt/ruyisdk
$ sudo tar -zxvf ruyisdk-0.0.3-linux.gtk."$(uname -m)".tar.gz
```

Run RuyiSDK IDE:

```bash
$ /opt/ruyisdk/ruyisdk/ruyisdk
```

In addition to the IDE itself, you will need to install the RuyiSDK IDE plugin. Currently, integration work is still in progress, so the plugin must be installed manually by copying it into the dropins directory of the RuyiSDK IDE. We plan to improve this experience in future releases to enable easier installation and usage. You can follow the steps below to install and use the plugin:

+ Download the latest plugin package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyisdk-eclipse-plugins/releases/latest)
+ Extract the `org.ruyisdk.ide_*.zip` archive into the `dropins` directory inside your RuyiSDK IDE installation path

## Use ruyi
