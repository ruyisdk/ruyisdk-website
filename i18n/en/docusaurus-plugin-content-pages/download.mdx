## Download RuyiSDK Package Manager

RuyiSDK Package Manager provides pre-built binaries for x86_64, riscv64, and aarch64 architectures.  
Run ``uname -m`` to check your system architecture, then download the appropriate binary.

<ArchSelector language="en"/>

:::tip
If the page does not properly display the download link, you can visit the [RuyiSDK mirror](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/) for the latest binaries.  
You can also find them on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases).
:::

### Install RuyiSDK Package Manager

The command above has been automatically generated according to your architecture.  
Make sure that the binary is installed as ``ruyi`` and located in a directory included in your ``PATH``.

:::tip
Note that the binary file name must be ``ruyi``.
:::

Run the following command to verify the installation:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
$ ruyi version
`} />

If the command outputs the version and copyright information,  
Ruyi is installed successfully. If it fails, check your system environment and repeat the steps.

### Enable Autocompletion

RuyiSDK supports command-line autocompletion for ``bash`` and ``zsh``.  
To enable it, add the corresponding script to your shell profile (e.g. ``.bashrc`` or ``.zshrc``):

For ``bash`` users:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
eval "$(ruyi --output-completion-script=bash)"
`} />

For ``zsh`` users:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
#compdef ruyi
eval "$(ruyi --output-completion-script=zsh)"
`} />

## Download RuyiSDK IDE

RuyiSDK IDE also provides binaries for x86_64, riscv64, and aarch64 architectures.  

You can download the tarball suitable for your architecture:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
$ wget https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ide/0.0.3/ruyisdk-0.0.3-linux.gtk."$(uname -m)".tar.gz
`} />

:::tip
This document may become outdated.  
If the example link points to an older version, please check the [RuyiSDK mirror](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ide/) for the latest binaries.
:::

### Install RuyiSDK IDE

The following demonstrates how to install RuyiSDK IDE into the ``/opt/ruyisdk`` directory.

First, create the directory:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
$ sudo mkdir /opt/ruyisdk
`} />

Unpack the tarball. This step requires tar and gunzip. Make sure to replace the filename with your actual downloaded tarball:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
$ cd /opt/ruyisdk
$ sudo tar -zxvf ruyisdk-0.0.3-linux.gtk."$(uname -m)".tar.gz
`} />

Run RuyiSDK IDE:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`
$ /opt/ruyisdk/ruyisdk/ruyisdk
`} />

### Install RuyiSDK IDE Plugins

In addition to the IDE itself, you will also need to install the RuyiSDK IDE plugins.  
Currently, the integration is still in progress, so plugins must be installed manually by copying them into the ``dropins`` directory of the RuyiSDK IDE.  
We plan to improve this experience in the future to allow easier installation and usage.  

For now, follow the steps below:

1. Download the latest plugin package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyisdk-eclipse-plugins/releases/latest)  
2. Extract the ``org.ruyisdk.ide_*.zip`` archive into the ``dropins`` directory inside your RuyiSDK IDE installation path  

## Get Started

Refer to the [documentation](https://ruyisdk.org/en/docs/intro/) to learn more about the powerful features of Ruyi.
