# About Us

## Introduction

RUYISDK is a comprehensive and integrated development environment designed specifically for RISC-V developers.
Led by the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS), RUYISDK aims to provide an all-in-one development solution for RISC-V developers. Planning for the project began in the second half of 2022, and since early 2024, it has adopted an agile bi-weekly release cycle. Since its inception, we have continuously optimized the product, striving to offer high-quality services to the vast RISC-V developer community.

## Core Objectives

1. Developers purchasing (virtually) any RISC-V development board or module can access hardware documentation, firmware/software updates, and debugging support through the RUYISDK system.
2. Developers can specify any commonly used RISC-V extension instruction set architecture combination and, through the RUYISDK system, generate the required operating system, toolchains, language runtime/virtual machine, computing libraries, application frameworks, and more. RUYISDK will fully support widely adopted draft standards such as Vector 0.7.1 and RVP 0.5.2, as well as vendor-specific extensions.
3. Foster and operate a vibrant, comprehensive developer community.
