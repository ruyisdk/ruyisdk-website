# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.13

RuyiSDK 0.13 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.13.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

+ https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.13.0
+ https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.13.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

+ Fixed [issue #158](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/issues/158): The two
  versions of the `coremark` package formerly had different directory layout
  after extraction. Now both are "flattened" into the current directory.
+ Fixed [issue #159](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/issues/159):
  inconsistency in handling of "pre-release" versions.
+ Following the official release of Python 3.12, the official `ruyi` binaries
  are now built in a Python 3.12 environment.
+ Preparatory work towards introduction of plugin architecture: support for
  the Starlark language has been introduced, with CI builds also supported.
  [Starlark] is a minimal dialect of Python that is widely adopted by build
  systems such as Bazel and BUCK. The choice of Starlark as the RuyiSDK
  Package Manager plugin language is meant to enable all developers familiar
  with the Python language to develop RuyiSDK Package Manager plugins with a
  familiar syntax.

[Starlark]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark

To support devices that require manual intervention during provisioning, and
whose images have to be downloaded manually, the RuyiSDK Device Provisioner is
now being refactored into a plugin-based architecture, with the next version
expected to be fit for testing. Older versions of the device provisioner will
stop working at that time; please upgrade before you test.
