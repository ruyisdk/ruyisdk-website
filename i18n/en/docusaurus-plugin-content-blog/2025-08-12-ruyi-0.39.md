# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.39

RuyiSDK 0.39 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.39.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

* https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.39.0
* https://pypi.org/project/ruyi/0.39.0/
* https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.39.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* `ruyi` is now [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ruyi/). Now you can install the RuyiSDK package manager with `pip install ruyi` or a similar command, as long as you have a Python environment.
* If you provide your own local RuyiSDK software repository by overriding its local path, and the remote URL of that repo's current branch differs from the corresponding `ruyi` configuration, `ruyi update` will now exit with an error instead of overwriting your remote URL.
* Continued polishing of shell completions:
    * Optimized `ruyi` startup latency in normal (non-completion) mode.
    * If the software repository has never been synchronized locally, `ruyi` no longer attempt to sync it during command-line completion.
* Engineering changes:
    * End-to-end integration tests now run for every PR to ensure typical CLI usage does not regress.
    * Shell completion scripts are now included in the `ruyi` source distribution under `contrib/shell-completions`, making it easier for distro packagers to integrate.
    * Preparing for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS packaging: the test suite now runs with pytest 6.2.5.
    * When building `ruyi`'s one-file distribution, prebuilt `cffi` and `pygit2` are used for the RISC-V build to reduce build times.
    * Simplified the `ruyi` release process: tagging and the release workflow are now automated.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

* Package updates:
    * `source/milkv-duo-examples`: Milk-V Duo example code, version 20241219.
* Improved device support:
    * RevyOS U-Boot for Milk-V Meles (4/8/16G variants): caught up with upstream versions.
    * RevyOS for Milk-V Pioneer and Milk-V Meles: added missing versions.
    * Buildroot SDK for Sipeed LicheeRV Nano: caught up with upstream versions.
* Engineering changes:
    * Formatted all package manifests and added a CI check to ensure new packages follow the unified coding style.
