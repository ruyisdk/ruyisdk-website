# New board images available (2024-01-29)

Image packages are now available for the following boards.

You can have your device automatically provisioned with the RuyiSDK Device
Provisioning Wizard `ruyi device provision`. Or you can still manually
install with `ruyi install`: files will be automatically unpacked or
symlinked to `~/.local/share/ruyi/blobs/<package name>-<version>`.

Thank you for supporting RuyiSDK!
