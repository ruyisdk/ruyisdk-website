# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.38

RuyiSDK 0.38 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.38.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

* https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.38.0
* https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/tags/0.38.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* Added `ruyi device flash` as an easier-to-remember alias for the RuyiSDK device provisioner. Thanks to [@Sequel] from the RuyiSDK community forum for the feedback!
* When `ruyi` needs to invoke an external command but cannot find it, it will now wait for you to install it and retry, if the current terminal is interactive. You can install the required command in another terminal, then return to the terminal where `ruyi` is running and press Enter to continue. You can also press Ctrl+C to exit. Thanks to [@Sequel] from the RuyiSDK community forum for the feedback!
