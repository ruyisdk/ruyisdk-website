# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.37

RuyiSDK 0.37 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.37.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

* https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.37.0
* https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/tags/0.37.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

* Added basic command-line completion support, initially for Bash and Zsh. Thanks to [@wychlw] for the contribution!

  To enable command-line completion for `ruyi`, source the completion script in your shell
  profile, e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

  ```sh
  # For zsh users: replace "bash" with "zsh"
  eval "$(ruyi --output-completion-script=bash)"
  ```

  Currently, subcommands of `ruyi` and package name arguments for commands like `ruyi install` are supported.

* `ruyi self clean` no longer crashes if the news read-state file does not exist. Thanks to [@weilinfox] for [reporting][ruyi-issue319] the bug!
* Python tracebacks are no longer shown to the user when fetching a remote Git repository fails.
* FTP passive mode is now only enabled for `curl` or `wget` when the download URL protocol is FTP. This fixes an issue where some RuyiSDK users were unable to download any files due to [a bug in cURL 8.14.1][curl-issue17545]. Thanks to [@weilinfox] for [reporting][ruyi-issue316] the `ruyi` bug!
* Refactored the handling of bundled resources in `ruyi`, decoupling it from the virtual environment mechanism. This allows for bundling other non-venv-related resources in the future, such as command-line completion scripts, internationalization string files, etc. A CI check is also in place to ensure the compressed resources included in `ruyi` are always in sync with the original files.
* Added support status for OpenCloudOS 9.4, openEuler 24.03 LTS SP2, openEuler 25.03, and openKylin 2.0. The Python dependencies for `ruyi` are partially missing on these distributions, but the versions of other dependencies are sufficient. We expect to have full support for them by October 2025.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

* Entity database updates:
    * Added the SpacemiT X60 micro-architecture.
    * Added the SpacemiT K1 processor model.
    * Added device variants for BananaPi BPI-F3 with eMMC and SD storage.
* Improved device support:
    * Updated the Buildroot SDK for Milk-V Duo (64 & 256M RAM variants) and Duo S (SD storage variant). Thanks to [@Cyl18] for the contribution!
    * Added support for the SD storage variant of BananaPi BPI-F3, with Bianbu Desktop and Bianbu Minimal systems provided by SpacemiT. Thanks to [@wychlw] for the contribution!
