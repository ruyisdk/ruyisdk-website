# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.11

RuyiSDK 0.11 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.11.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

- https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.11.0
- https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.11.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

- Removed the only LGPL dependency so far. The entirety of RuyiSDK Package
  Manager and its dependencies are now permissively licensed, which means
  downstream users are free to use the RuyiSDK Package Manager in a
  commercial fashion from now on.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

- The Ruyi Device Provisioner (`ruyi device provision`) now supports the following device models:
  - Pine64 Star64

Please run `ruyi update` to pull in the update after upgrading the RuyiSDK
package manager.

We have noticed that more and more device models (even including the newly
announced BananaPi BPI-F3) are having their system images distributed by
means of net-disks only, such as Baidu Netdisk, Google Drive or MEGA.
It is a challenge to support such models due to this; we will attempt to do
so nevertheless in the coming releases. Stay tuned and your contribution is
welcome!
