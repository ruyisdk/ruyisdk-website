# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.12

RuyiSDK 0.12 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.12.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

- https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.12.0
- https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.12.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

- The Pine64 Star64 Armbian image can now be correctly downloaded.
- The user experience for downloading fetch-restricted files is implemented.
  A hint message will be rendered according to the current system locale setting
  when such a file is requested.
- pygit2 has been upgraded to 1.5.0 to support libgit2 1.8.
- The `XDG_STATE_HOME` environment variable is now correctly respected.

To support devices that require manual intervention during provisioning, and
whose images have to be downloaded manually, the RuyiSDK Device Provisioner is
now being refactored to handle those complex situations, with the next version
expected to be fit for testing. Older versions of the device provisioner will
stop working at that time; please upgrade before you test.
