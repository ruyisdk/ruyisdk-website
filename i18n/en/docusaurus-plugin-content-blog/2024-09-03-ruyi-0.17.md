# Release notes for RuyiSDK 0.17

RuyiSDK 0.17 is now released. The corresponding package manager version is also 0.17.0.
You can download the RuyiSDK package manager from one of the following locations:

+ https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/tag/0.17.0
+ https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/0.17.0/

This update mainly consists of the following changes. Happy hacking!

## RuyiSDK Package Manager

+ Fixed [issue #181](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/issues/181): When using features like `ruyi news read` in narrower terminal windows, long lines in Markdown code blocks no longer have missing characters, and there are no spaces at the beginning or end of lines that would affect copy-paste operations. The tradeoff is that the full-width beautiful background color is no longer implemented.

## RuyiSDK Software Repository

+ Updated Box64 to the latest upstream development version.
+ Updated WPS Office to the latest upstream version. Note: Upstream has removed native support for AArch64 architecture. These users will also need to rely on binary translation solutions to run WPS Office.
+ Clarified the open source license for the software repository content: Apache 2.0 license, consistent with the Ruyi package manager itself.
