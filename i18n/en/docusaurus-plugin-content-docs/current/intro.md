# Hello Ruyi

Welcome to the introduction of [RuyiSDK](https://github.com/ruyisdk). Below are the key topics covered in this document:

> 1. What is RuyiSDK -> Introduction
> 2. Why RuyiSDK exists -> Background
> 3. What can RuyiSDK do -> Features
> 4. On which devices can I run it -> Supported Devices
> 5. How does RuyiSDK work -> RuyiSDK Architecture Diagram
> 6. Where should I start -> Let's Get Started!

## Introduction

RuyiSDK is an open-source project initiated by [PLCT Lab](https://plctlab.org/), aiming to provide RISC-V developers with a convenient and comprehensive development environment. It offers the latest hardware information and software support, such as hardware compatibility details for supported devices. On the software side, it provides system images (e.g., [RevyOS](https://github.com/ruyisdk/revyos)), toolchains, package managers, and more.

The ultimate goal is to create a robust and user-friendly development environment for RISC-V developers, promoting RISC-V as a mainstream architecture. Additionally, it aims to build and maintain a thriving community for developer collaboration. Ultimately, RuyiSDK aspires to go global, offering development convenience to RISC-V developers worldwide.

## Background

RISC-V is the fifth-generation reduced instruction set architecture, an open-source project initiated by the University of California, Berkeley. Compared to CISC, it is more streamlined and offers higher instruction execution efficiency. Its open-source nature allows for easier adoption across various fields, including IoT, smart home devices, chip design, operating systems, and software development.

Historically, RISC-V development faced challenges due to the lack of a unified platform for information, significantly reducing the efficiency of learning and application development. RuyiSDK was created to address these issues.

## Features

![RuyiSDK](./RuyiSDK.png)

RuyiSDK is divided into the following three components:

### [Ruyi Package Manager](/docs/category/ruyi-包管理器)

This package manager is an online software repository that provides the following:

```
1. Toolchains
2. Debugging tools
3. Simulators
4. Runtime environments
5. Documentation
6. Source code
7. Tools and system images
8. GUI (TODO)
```

### [Ruyi IDE](/docs/category/ruyisdk-ide)

This IDE is a development toolbox designed for the RISC-V architecture. Developers can easily obtain it through the Ruyi package manager, enabling efficient code writing and debugging for real-world development scenarios. Using the package manager, developers can access toolchains, debugging tools, and simulators, allowing them to write and debug programs either on simulators or RISC-V development boards.

### [Community](/contact)

Our community offers a wealth of technical articles, code, tutorial videos, and offline events to gather user feedback. Additionally, an online forum is available for developers to exchange technical knowledge.

RuyiSDK's integration and support for RISC-V devices include the following aspects:

1. Information and tutorials for downloading and installing RISC-V development board images, making it easier for developers to obtain relevant images (essentially providing an image repository). This includes various operating systems (e.g., Debian-based RevyOS, openEuler RISC-V, etc.) for developers to use.
2. Maintenance and download of demonstration programs, development materials, and related tools (including applicable toolchains and simulators) for RISC-V development boards, enabling developers to get started quickly.
3. Adding RISC-V device-specific wizard pages to the integrated development environment, enabling file transfer between development and runtime environments, and supporting application debugging on RISC-V devices.

## Supported Devices
