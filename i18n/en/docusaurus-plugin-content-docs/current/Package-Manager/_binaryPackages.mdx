## Installing with Precompiled Binaries
> Supported Architectures: Linux x86_64 arm64 riscv64

### Download the RuyiSDK Package Manager

The RuyiSDK package manager is currently available as precompiled binaries for **Linux** systems, supporting three architectures: **amd64** (i.e., x86_64), **arm64**, and **riscv64**. It does not rely on the systemâ€™s Python environment, making it broadly compatible across setups.

They are simultaneously published on both GitHub Releases and the ISCAS mirror site:

- [ruyi GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/)
- [ISCAS Mirror](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/ruyisdk/ruyi/releases/)

This guide uses the ISCAS mirror as an example. First, run `uname -m` to check your system architecture, then download the corresponding binary.

### Install the RuyiSDK Package Manager

The command above has been auto-generated based on your system architecture. Make sure the binary is named `ruyi` and placed in a directory included in your `PATH`.

To verify the installation, run:

<CodeBlock lang="bash" showTitleCopyButton="true" code={`
$ ruyi version
`} />

If the command executes and prints the copyright information, the installation was successful. If unexpected output appears, please check your installation steps and system environment.

:::tip Troubleshooting
- The installed file **must** be named `ruyi` (do not include architecture suffixes).
- Ensure the `ruyi` binary has executable permissions.
- se `echo $PATH` to confirm that the directory containing `ruyi` is included in your `PATH` environment variable.
:::
:::tip Custom Installation Path
- If you prefer a custom installation directory, modify the `/usr/local/bin` path in the command accordingly, and ensure your `PATH` includes that directory.
- Installing `ruyi` to `~/.local/bin/ruyi` is often recommended, as it allows installation and removal without superuser privileges. In this case, make sure `~/.local/bin/` is part of your `PATH`.
