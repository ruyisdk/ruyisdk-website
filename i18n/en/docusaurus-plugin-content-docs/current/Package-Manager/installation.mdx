# Installation

:::tip Friendly Reminder
- By downloading and using RuyiSDK, you agree to the license terms and [privacy policy](https://ruyisdk.org/en/docs/legal/privacyPolicy/).
- This documentation uses `~` to represent the current user's home directory. When necessary, please use the absolute path (on most Linux systems, this is typically something like `/home/your-username`). You may see `/home/foo` used as a placeholder in examples—please replace it with your actual environment path.
- Each installation method supports different operating systems and hardware architectures. Before proceeding, make sure your environment matches the `Supported Architectures` listed in the relevant section.
:::

Let’s begin with installing the RuyiSDK package manager.

There are currently three installation methods available, each suited to different scenarios. Please choose the one that best fits your system and architecture:
1.  **Install with Precompiled Binary (Recommended)**
    *   **Highlights**: Broadest OS and hardware support; minimal system requirements.
    *   **Best for**: Almost all users, especially beginners looking for a quick setup.

2.  **Install via System Package Manager**
    *   **Highlights**: Installed like any regular software using system commands (e.g., `apt`, `yum`).
    *   **Prerequisite**: Your Linux distribution must officially include the `ruyi` package.

3.  **Install via Python’s pip Tool**
    *   **Highlights**: Uses Python’s package manager `pip` for installation.
    *   **Best for**: Users who already have a Python development environment configured.

Now, choose the method that suits your system and preferences to get started!
